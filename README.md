Layout of an existing house using measurements and math (and Metapost).

This is the result of my frustration with existing tools for laying
out the floorplan of a house. The professional options are
prohibitively expensive and overwhelming to learn just to make a
single layout for my current house. The consumer tools are all lame.
My biggest gripe is that when you update a measurement it doesn't
reflect the rest of the house. So, I decided to write some (very)
simple Metapost code to lay the house out using math.
