** Motivation

Create an acurate floor plan and layout of Wildwood house with
locations of wires and pipes and everything important.

Distinguish actual measurements vs calculated measurements.

Maybe record many measurements and take an average.

Show pictures with overlayed locations of measurements and record
whether it includes trim (etc) or not.

Ideally use text format to describe stuff and output to something
graphical.

** Actual Measurements

*** Garage

 - West-East wall-to-wall:
 - North-South wall-to-garage-door:
 - Floor-to-ceiling:


** Basic layout

Garage: 26' x 27'
Living Room: 38' x 14.5'
