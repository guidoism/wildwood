* Tables
** Measurements

This is where we put all of the raw measurements. I like to draw a
room on paper and label all of the possible dimensions. Then I fill
in those labels on another paper with the labels listed out.

In this example I am using feet with decimal fractions. I find this a
lot easier to deal with than feet, inches, and 16ths of an inch. It's
clear that I have too many significant digits but I like to just
record exactly what the laser measuring tool tells me and know that
small inaccuracies will average out in the end.

Also note that the measurements labeled with "℮" are estimates. This
is where I screwed something up during the measurement or I couldn't
get my tool into a small place.

Note that you can also define measurements in terms of other
measurements either in this same room or other. See Hallbath
below as an example. These equations follow the same rules
layed on in Metapost.

** Paths

This is where we define the paths that each of the rooms' walls make.
This is a huge departure from normal floorplan applications. We are
going to define each room seperately starting at the origin and moving
around counter-clockwise until we form a cycle. We ignore all windows,
doors, and shared walls at this point. This is just defining the
interior perception of a room.

These are cartesian coordinates. Note that it doesn't matter that you
go into the negative, but I like to keep all of my origins at the
perceptual lower-left of the room.

I may change this to optionally allow turtle-style paths since they
are more natural to define.

** Relative Positions

This is where we define the relative positions of the rooms. For
example room 1's upper right corner might be the same as Room 2's
lower left corner.

** Inputs for 3D CAD

We'd like to do a 3D model of our house too. Because programs like
OpenSCAD scan extrude 2D drawings from SVGs into the third dimension
we can produce a few drawings and treat them as "slices" in the third
dimensions. For example, we start with just the walls and doors and we
can extrude up until the lowest window elevation, then we extrude up
again until there's another change in layout, etc.

mpost --mem=metafun slice1.mp && open -a Safari slice1.svg

Since our operations are doing a lot of undrawing which isn't actually
transparent and makes the extruding not work. So, the easiest thing to
fix this problem I think is to export to a high resolution png and use
that to import the 2d shape into OpenSCAD.
