** Floor plan slices, extrude up until the slice is different

We will start with the floor pretending that the doors don't exist so
there will be openings there. Then we extrude up until we hit the
lowest window, then the slice changes and we extrude up again until
we get to a new slice, and on and on.

We should be able to use anything to generate the slices, not just
OpenSCAD.

*** Just do it in OpenSCAD
